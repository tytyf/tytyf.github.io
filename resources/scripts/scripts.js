This is mainly due to my rigorous academics in high school which garnered many units before graduating. I am currently on track to graduating in a year and a half with four majors: Business Administration, Economics, Physics, and Mathematics. I won’t go into too much detail about why I chose these majors, but all I can say is that I’m excited for the next year here at Sierra! It’s been a great time getting to meet new people and learn about others’ experiences across all walks of life. \n\nIn addition, I am well versed in honor society/volunteer activities as I was a member of NHS in high school which required me to obtain at least 200 community service hours and excellent academics. I served as a church leader for kids for over 4 years and have gained the necessary skills it takes to lead others. I believe that my life experiences have also shaped who I am as a student, leader, and human being. I passionately care for the wellbeing of others and genuinely want to see people succeed and reach their goals. I believe as a leader in Phi Theta Kappa, I can apply my leadership skills to help guide the next generation of ambitious students.

      "qualities": "Firstly, being a team player has always been one of my best qualities. I love working in groups and having the ability to collaborate and share ideas. I believe teamwork is crucial in life, but especially necessary for a club like PTK. If we are organizing/creating events that students and/or the public are attending, it is important to work together and discuss how we can make the event as efficient as possible, as well as being open to ideas that could improve the event or club in general. Everyone has a right to be heard and everyone’s voice matters. I feel like sometimes people want to share their ideas but don’t, in spite of the fear that others will judge them. This brings me on to my next quality, I have been told that I am very approachable and a good listener. This contributes to our PTK chapter because I want to keep a positive environment in club. By being an affable person, people are able to talk to me about anything and I’ll always be there to listen. Especially when there is a board of directors or just a lot of members in the club, sometimes people can feel left out, or that their voices aren’t being heard. I want to make sure that this doesn’t happen and contribute to PTK being a safe and welcoming place for all. My third quality is accountability. In group work settings, I believe it is very important to hold oneself accountable for their actions and/or duties. In order to lead a team or club, people have to step up to the plate and be accountable for the duties they committed to.",
      "desiredPosition": "I have real-world experience, knowledge, and background that applies to the duties for VP or VP of communications. To begin, over the summer of 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to do an international internship for the top Public Relations Company in the Philippines, EON. There I got to experience and work in the fashion/lifestyle department, as well as the video/production department. While being an intern here, I got the exposure of seeing all aspects of what makes a successful PR company as well as being completely by myself for the first time and experiencing an entirely different culture and environment as a 17/18-year-old. Some of the clients I worked with during my time at EON included Uniqlo, Netflix, and Nike. I was assigned tasks such as emailing, responding and communicating with Influencers, media outlets, fashion critiques, etc all of whom were on the guest-list for PR events. This experience would be beneficial to the duties of VP, as I have a good idea of how to organize/plan induction as well as organize meetings. \n\nA huge part of this job was to always available to answer questions and collaborate with others. My coworkers and I were always bouncing ideas off of each other to see what events we could create. This is very similar to how our meetings are in PTK. Moreover, I fully understand that communication is a huge part to play in getting any type of task done. Communicating with everyone in the group is important to all be on the same page, finish projects in a quick and efficient manner, and create successful events. Not to mention, being able to work with the video/production committee allowed me to see the process of interviews, pictures, videos, editing, etc. Photography/videography is already a passion I have. I spend my free time editing pictures and/or videos, taking senior pics, and just having fun photoshoots with my friends. Therefore, I would love to run the media accounts and take high-quality pics at PTK events/meetings, which will eventually be put on our social pages. \n\nRight now I work as a personal assistant for the founder of the Aspire marketing company. I carry out marketing jobs predominantly for business and finance clients. This type of work involves lots of communication and prioritization to get orders or tasks done. A major task I handle is working Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to achieve high search engine rankings for clients. In addition to this, I also communicate with marketing directors for business/finance websites to discuss ad rates. In all, I have a pretty good knowledge of my way around the internet and running a business online. Not to mention, by working as a personal assistant I have the skills capable of helping the President of PTK complete any tasks he/she needs. \n\nI also own my own skincare business with Rodan+Fields. This has allowed me to gain social media marketing tools as well as the ability to talk on the phone, answer questions, respond to emails, DMs, etc. An essential part of this business is collaborating and communicating with my up-line, as well as learning from others. I am constantly in touch with others in the company and have learned that the best way to grow in a direct sales company is to exchange ideas and information from those who are already succeeding. \n\nIn all, I believe I have valuable assets to bring to PHI THETA KAPPA, as the VP or VP of Communications. I have through background and knowledge that would help bring PTK’s leadership or social pages to the next level. PTK is one of the most prominent clubs on campus that a lot of students don’t actually know or hear about. I’d love the opportunity to showcase what our club has to offer and become as successful as we can as we enter the upcoming school year.",
      "hardships": "I’d say the biggest hardship was COVID-19 stopping school and clubs from operating. I joined PTK this Spring semester and was only able to attend the meetings we had before school shut down. However, I went to the Homeless Outreach project in Sac, as well as the painting event for the Senior Living community. Both of these events were very eye-opening and insightful. I just wish we had more time together as a club to get to know each other and organize events in the community.  \n\nAdditionally, I wouldn’t really call this a hardship...but PTK having a GPA requirement has only pushed me more to excel in my studies and keep up a good grade point average so I can continue to be an active official member of this club. \n\nLastly, as a college student, the PTK membership fee was a lot. However, I am fortunate enough to have a job I can work from home, especially during this time with everything going on in the world. I was able to save up money and pay the fee.",

I also find that my creativity and resourcefulness have helped me with my conflict resolution skills. \nAnother quality of mine that I think will benefit PTK are my communication skills. Through my current job and internship, I have learned the importance and necessity of clear communication. I have found that one can never over communicate and that it is vital to communicate in a way for people to not merely understand, but more importantly, to not misunderstand in any given situation.   \nOne last quality I feel that I can contribute to our PTK chapter is my intercultural sensitivity and my ability to work with different personnel. I have been in many situations with people of other cultures and backgrounds and these experiences with them have increased my knowledge and compassion for others. Additionally, I take pride in my ability to make individual connections with people. I believe that making connections with our PTK members and other students at Sierra College is a way to take PTK to an extremely personal level.",
      "desiredPosition": "I am most interested in the Vice President position of PTK. Because I have been involved with PTK over the past year, I think Sierra’s chapter of PTK would benefit from my knowledge base about our organization and goals. I have grown familiar with the setup and expectations of the honor society so I am confident that my experience would help our chapter to continue to move forward in developing and growing. I have taken many Humanities classes and many Business classes and both arenas have provided me with skill sets that would make me very successful as the Vice President. The Humanities classes I have taken have broadened my knowledge of the world and have increased my compassion and understanding for people who come from other cultures and religions. I feel like this knowledge will help me be able to connect with people from all walks of life and make sure everyone who comes to PTK feels included and seen. I  believe that the business classes I have taken will also help me in the role of Vice President. Even though Phi Theta Kappa itself is not a business, it has a very similar structure to business entities. The classes I have taken in accounting, marketing, and business ethics have given me the knowledge on how a successful organization is run from the inside. I think my previous experience with Phi Theta Kappa and the many useful classes I have taken will help me be very successful as Vice President for our chapter of PTK.",
      "hardships": "I unfortunately have been faced with extreme hardships in regards to my health.

During my senior year in high school I was forced to be taken out of school due to a very rare sickness. I was luckily able to graduate, however my doctors advised me not to leave for college, therefore I decided to attend Sierra College. In my first year at Sierra, I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA despite having to constantly miss classes due to doctor’s appointments. During this time I was also required to be on harsh medications that caused me to constantly have to cut my days short because the side effects made it extremely difficult to merely function through the day. In the beginning of my second year at Sierra, I was diagnosed with multiple heart conditions that led to me having open heart surgery at the end of that semester. During this Fall semester I completed my six classes two weeks early so I could proceed with my scheduled surgery and I was still able to maintain my 4.0 GPA.

      "qualities": "Three of my best qualities I feel would contribute positively to PTK are my dedication, determination, and innovation. I am dedicated to any task I’m given or any commitments I make. Whatever my role will be I will do it to the best of my ability and will prioritize my duties. Another attribute is how I am determined to complete any task given. I like to see any commitment I make through as well as I’m hardworking and willing to make the time needed to complete my tasks. A final attribute I feel is beneficial is my innovative skills. I am willing to adapt and ensure that a task is done to the fullest yet will continue to think of how anything can be improved; nothing is perfect the first time, it is important to keep an open mind about how improvements can be made.",
      "desiredPosition": "The position that I am most interested in is President. I am currently an officer of PTK and have been a member for a year and a half. I have watched how the board/club operate from the inside and out and would like a chance to show what I’ve learned and help lead this club for the next coming terms. I have held officer positions in clubs prior to this, and although I haven’t taken any classes that would directly correlate, I feel I have enough experience and determination that I would be a good fit.",
      "hardships": "I haven’t had too many hardships in regards to the qualifications to being a member since for financial reasons my full time status and GPA are vital. I have, however, had difficulties with finding all the time when I first became a member. It was a daunting task to not only balance classes and work as well as a new club, but regardless I was excited to join and willing to find the time. I was able to figure out ways to better manage my time and have been excited at the opportunities granted to me because of this, such as being able to be an officer.",
      "additionalInformation": "I would just like the committee to be aware that not only have I been an officer of PTK, but that I have truly enjoyed my position and would just be happy to return as a member of the board.",

      "qualities": "I am an extremely organized person, which is illustrated through my work with Salam Sierra where I initiated and executed a \"Know Your Rights\" event on campus. (Which unfortunately was cancelled due to the virus). Additionally, after leading four successful years in Moot Court, I was asked to come back and coach the championship team, allowing me to gain  immense administrative and leadership skills. My experience with Moot Court not only enhanced my abilities to speak publicly with ease and communicate very effectively, but also taught me how to collaboratively engage in teamwork. The internships and clubs I have participated in have shaped me into a great communicator and a reliable team worker that will benefit PTK greatly.",
      "desiredPosition": "The VP of Service position requires an individual who can efficiently organize all of the committees and communicate with the committee leads to assure everything is running smoothly. When I was teaching at Tarbiya Institute after school program, organization was key in my success as a teacher. I created lesson plans and then made sure I communicated them out to both parents and my fellow colleagues. As an intern at the Crimmigration Law Firm, I was responsible for much of the organization of cases, specifically putting together the case packets we would send out to USCIS. I have a variety of experiences that all taught me the value of being organized in order to efficiently carry out my responsibilities.",
      "hardships": "At just the age of five, my little sister had been referred to the oncologist, she had already gone through multiple MRI’s, bone scans, and eventually a biopsy. But this was just the beginning.\nFatemah was admitted in the hospital for a couple of weeks as doctors spoke confusing\nmedical terms. I come from a family of six very close-knit siblings, and seeing my little sister in\nthis helpless condition took an emotional toll on me. Not only that, Fatemah and I share a room.\nWhen she woke up in the middle of the night screaming from pain, I woke up with her.\nConstantly tired in class, I carried the additional burden of emotional stress as the doctors were\nnot able to give us answers we desperately needed. I was balancing caring for my sister,\nproviding emotional support to my family and simultaneously maintaining my GPA. I was also\nbusy with internships, jobs, sports, and volunteering. With all the time we were spending at the\nhospital, I learned the crucial lessons of time management, communication and organization, as\nmy parents spent the bulk of their physical and emotional investment in Fatemah. When she was finally diagnosed three years later with Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis, a rare disease only one in a million people have, I was better equipped to handle\nthe mental and emotional stress. Because of the rarefied nature of the disease, doctors were not sure what could cure her. For me, this meant completing pages of homework for advanced\nplacement classes while I waited in the hospital waiting room for her numerous appointments.\nWith the majority of my siblings gone from home, the bulk of the responsibility fell to me as I\nneeded to take care of tasks at home. But I had learned the skill of time management in the early days, and I powered through,maintaining my GPA, academic, and social schedule, while being a supportive sister. I lived my life, while being a positive influence on my sister’s life.",

Whether it's planning events or maintaining relationships, even when it becomes difficult, I would say a good quality of mine is to persevere through to get the job done. An example of this would be my enrollment and academic success at Sierra, as even though it would be a low priority for many in my situation, I still made it my duty to see through I reach my educational goals.\n2. I take pride in my adaptability and self sufficiency. For a majority of my academic life at Sierra, I haven't had stable housing or income, but the unpredictability of my personal life has made me adaptable for situations to come.\n3. I like to help people in any way possible. I may not currently have a lot to offer besides my time, but what I can do is use that time to help those in need. One of the key attractions of PTK that had me interested were the numerous committees and the events run by this organization to help the community and students in the area.",
      "desiredPosition": "I would be more than honored to have the opportunity to hold any position on the board, but the VP of Communications, in particular, stands out to me for a few reasons. I have experience running for-profit niche pages on social media platforms like Instagram and I’m also the Website Manager of Cello Chocolate Student Enterprises. Additionally, I feel that communication is an extremely important tool that can be used to bring in more potential PTK members, similar to marketing, \"It doesn't matter how good your product is if people don't know you're selling it.\" I think PTK is an amazing organization that, unfortunately, people (which almost included me) go throughout their semesters on campus without even hearing about, and I would love to lead the initiative of changing that.",
      "hardships": "My main hardship to overcome qualifying for my PTK membership was simply the situation I was in.
