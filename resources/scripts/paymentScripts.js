Somehow I still managed to pull all A's in all four of my classes. Making the President's List last semester and then getting the honor of being invited to join Phi Theta Kappa has been very rewarding to me with all the losses I've taken in my personal life. It has made me so proud of myself for deciding to go back to college and further my education for myself."

Which compliments being a hard worker. It took till this last year to motivate myself to go back to school, I’m 26, and I was feeling like I was ‘too old’ until I realized there are people older than I am who have been incredibly successful in their lives and there is no reason I can’t be too. Thirdly, I’m empathetic. I care about people and the planet and whatever career I end up with I am hoping it will benefit one, the other or both. I think it’s important to be able to understand how other people feel and more importantly I think it’s important to understand how beneficial nature is to us and our souls. I think it’s easy to not care in this world because you can get hurt but I am trying to learn to “spread love” while still protecting myself and allowing myself to be strong for others.",
      "hardships": "My biggest hardship to qualify for PTK was overcoming myself. In high school I was depressed and not motivated to learn, I was blind to what good grades would do for me at that age. I felt college would only be the same as high school and that I wouldn’t be motivated to do the work, so I waited. I waited until last year when I felt that I have matured, and I have so much more since I was 18. I realized how if I want to have a career I enjoy and also make a difference in this world, even a small one, that I would need a degree. So I enrolled. It was the best decision I made last year and it was a good decision to allow myself to wait till now to start college. In high school I never had a 4.0 and was never motivated to get myself there so I truly never knew I was smart enough to be an honor student. Receiving the email about being able to join PTK motivated me to continue to do great in college. There is nothing I would love more than to graduate with honors to show my family that I have also graduated beyond being that unmotivated teenager and also to show myself I’m smarter than I think I am and lastly other people who might be waiting to start college because they feel the same way I did.",
      "payment": "I work part time and it’s just enough to pay the bills each month and I can’t work any more without losing valuable time that I get to work on homework.

      "contribution": "I would try to make time to attend meetings, however Friday is a big work day for me so it may be difficult. However, I will try to get involved in any ways I can. If there are PTK events that go on I will gladly attend and if I have time will try to get involved in preparations. I also would be happy to talk to and try to motivate others who are 25+ in college, it can be intimidating and I think it’s helpful to have people to talk to about. Also after being out of high school for so long it can be easy to forget much of what you learned and I’d love to work with others my age and older to study who perhaps also feel a refresher would help them out.",
      "additionalInformation": "Any ways the committee thinks I would be helpful to PTK or could get involved in other ways I would love to know. If there are ways for me to be helpful online as well I would have a lot of flexibility to do so."

I am impressed with the different committees that have been, and are currently helping students and future students alike to thrive in different ways at Sierra College. This aligns well with my personality and goal to help those around me will I continue to better myself through education. \n\nI also pride myself with finding innovative ways to accomplish a task. I enjoy challenging myself with an idea that has not been tried yet. I feel this will be a useful quality to the chapter since new ideas for committees and projects are needed to reach out to as many as possible. Ideas are the lifeblood of any secular or educational organization and I am happy to contribute as much as possible to the missions and goals for the Beta Mu Zeta. \n\nLastly, I enjoy and function well in a team environment. I get excited when a team project is announced in class.

For the next 10 years, I learned and grew my skill set and career as a financial analyst and accountant. However, 3 years ago I met and married my wife here in California and we just had a beautiful baby girl as of February 2020. This has motivated me to finish what I started in the fall of 2005.
